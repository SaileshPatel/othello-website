The Back Button is almost done but will have to implement a switch scene which is going to be done by Bruno and Zak, the deadline for this will be the 27th February.

On the options menu we will have to create a slider which will enable the user to adjust sound levels. Zak will implement a slider as well as the design.

A new AI has been added which is an upgrade as it is a bit smarter. Both John and Vinny will be working to improve the use of AI.

For the animation we needed a set of images to run until the end. Sprites need to be stored in array. The Ray- Tracing could do pre-rendering. We will also require a Background for the Game, Zak has volunteered to create images for sprites.

After reviewing  Zaks's Code,  we found that  the only issue is that the volume can be adjusted via terminal. Sailesh and John will complete the code review as we need to get rid of terminal manipulation
