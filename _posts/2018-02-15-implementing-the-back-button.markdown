This week meeting we discussed about different matters such Back button, option menu, Ai networking and animation.
Bruno was able to complete the back button, therefore the coming week he is going to work with Zak to implement the back button and to implement the switch screen.  

On the option menu, we discuss that a slider to adjust a volume is needed, therefore zak is going to work on it as well as creating images for sprites for the animation.  

For the coming week John and vinny  will implement AI strategies.

Charlie and managed to get pinging working but they need to finalise it using serialisation, therefore the for the coming week,  they will need to figure out how  to implement it within Othello.
