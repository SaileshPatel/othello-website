Welcome! We're happy (and a bit sad) to be writing this blog post as this is our last blog post, as this is the final countdown to the game being completed.

## Animation
After our discussion on animation, Jmes and Zak went off and implemented counter flips, so whenever a piece is placed, the resulting movement of opposing pieces now flip.

In addition to this, the discussion on the delay on flips has also led to a small delay on flips, which means that counters, which flip in succession will flip in order.

## Artificial Intelligence
Following on from last weeks blog post, we've finally managed to implement a hard mode for the AI now, so players can now play against an easy, medium and hard mode.

This is a huge step because now players have a variety of artificial intelligence players they can play against. This combined with the new improved animation adds the finishing touches to our game.

## Networking
According to Charlie, the networking has almost been completed, and all he needs to do now is attempt to add some threading in order to avoid the game going in to a 'resting' state.

Charlie has said that he'll attempt to get this functionality working, however due to the strict time constraint, we haven't been able to do full quality assurance on this feature.

## Sound Effects
Following on from our discussion around the use of sound effects, Eastwood has made some awesome sound effects, including a placement sound, a rejection sound and a sound for flipping the consecutive counters.

## Improved Textures
Thanks to Zak & James, we have found some awesome new textures, which have replaced some of our old out-dated texture, which has led to our game looking a lot nicer.

## Final Words...

We'd like to thank our interested readers for sticking with us and following the development of our game, Othello. We're really happy to have been given the opportunity to develop a new adaptation of Othello for this modern age.
