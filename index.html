<h1>Welcome</h1>
<p>Welcome to our developmental website for Team 4's implementation of Othello.</p>

<h2>Who?</h2>
<p>We are a team of nine, with various skill sets and abilities, who have come together to build a fully functioning video game based on Othello, a popular board game.</p>
<p>If you'd like to find out more about the team, head over to our <a href="about/">About</a> page.</p>

<h2>Why?</h2>
<p>This is a development blog for our group project for the module CS2010. In our group project, we are re-creating the board game, Othello, as a video game.</p>

<p>Our intended purpose for this project is to create a 21st century version of Othello in order to revitalise a board game for a new generation.</p>

<h2>What?</h2>
<p>Othello is a strategy-based game centered around placing pieces on a board. The aim of the game is to flip the opponents pieces in order to have more pieces on the board.</p>
